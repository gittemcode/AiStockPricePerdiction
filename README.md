S&P 500 Market Prediction Model
Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict S&P 500 market movements using historical data. The model uses a Random Forest Classifier with various technical indicators and rolling averages to predict whether the market will rise or fall on the next trading day.
Features

Historical S&P 500 data retrieval using yfinance
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Implementation of Random Forest Classifier
Backtesting system for model validation
Technical indicators including multiple rolling averages
Probability-based prediction threshold
Visualization of predictions and actual market movements

Dependencies

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
yfinance
scikit-learn

Installation
bashCopypip install pandas numpy matplotlib yfinance scikit-learn
Usage

Import required libraries and download S&P 500 data:

pythonCopyimport pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

Initialize and download S&P 500 data:

pythonCopysp500 = yf.Ticker("^GSPC")
sp500 = sp500.history(period="max")

Run the prediction model:


The model uses historical data from 1990 onwards
Incorporates multiple technical indicators including rolling averages
Predicts market movements with a 60% confidence threshold

Model Details

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
Parameters:

n_estimators: 200
min_samples_split: 50
random_state: 1


Prediction threshold: 0.6 (60% confidence required for positive prediction)

Performance

Model achieves approximately 57% precision in predicting market upward movements
Baseline market upward movement: 53%
Conservative prediction strategy with higher confidence threshold
Backtesting implemented for historical performance validation

Features Used for Prediction

Basic price data (Close, Open, High, Low, Volume)
Rolling averages across multiple time horizons (2, 5, 60, 250, 1000 days)
Price ratios relative to moving averages
Historical trend indicators

Limitations

Based solely on technical analysis and historical price data
Does not incorporate fundamental analysis or market sentiment
Past performance does not guarantee future results
Limited to daily predictions on the S&P 500 index

Future Improvements

Integration of additional technical indicators
Incorporation of sentiment analysis
Optimization of model parameters
Addition of risk management features
Support for individual stock prediction
